      <p>Popcorn Chicken or Chicken Popcorn are small slices of chicken that were coated in flour and deep fried until it turns light to medium brown. This is a kid favorite and goes well with most dipping sauces. Speaking about dipping sauce, some of the favorites that goes well with this are barbecue, honey mustard, sweet and sour, and ranch. I also enjoy having this with Sriracha mayo.</p>

                  <li>Dip the tilapia fillet in the bowl with beaten egg then dredge the tilapia in Panko breadcrumbs. ake sure that the tilapia is well coated. To save more breadcrumbs and for better coating, you can place the breadcrumbs in a container with cover. Simply put 2 to 3 pieces if tilapia fillet in the container with breadcrumbs, cover it, and then shake the container back and forth. You will see that the tilapia will be coated properly.</li>
