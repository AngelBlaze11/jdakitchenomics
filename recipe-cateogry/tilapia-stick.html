      <p>Crispy Tilapia Sticks is a delicious crispy flavorful tilapia fillet dish. The fish is seasoned and dredged in a beading of Panko breadcrumbs, then deep fried until crispy. Crispy Tilapia Sticks makes a delicious appetizer and I think that it goes well with fresh homemade ranch dressing.</p>

                <li> Dip the tilapia fillet in the bowl with beaten egg then dredge the tilapia in Panko breadcrumbs. ake sure that the tilapia is well coated. To save more breadcrumbs and for better coating, you can place the breadcrumbs in a container with cover. Simply put 2 to 3 pieces if tilapia fillet in the container with breadcrumbs, cover it, and then shake the container back and forth. You will see that the tilapia will be coated properly.</li>
